        "Explanation": "If you created a character list using the Teensyville option in The Script character list creator tool, then you may want to use the Toymaker. Games set in Teensyville have only 6 Townsfolk, 2 Outsiders, 2 Minions and 1 Demon on the list, and specifically cater to 5 or 6 players.\nWith the Toymaker in-play, the Demon learns 3 not-in-play characters at the start of the game, and the Minion(s) and Demon learn who each other are. Once per game, the Demon must voluntarily choose to attack nobody tonight. If the Demon has not yet done this, and the Demon is about wake to attack a player (and this would end the game), then do not wake the Demon \u2013 they are forced to attack nobody tonight."
