        "Tips & Tricks (if you are evil)": "For the first few days of the game, you will have enormous power to get good players killed. On the first day, you can kill any good player of your choice, since you are the only voting player. On the second day, with 2 or 3 players voting, you still have a strong possibility of swinging the votes you don't like in the direction of players you want to die, and not those you don't. From the third day onward, your personal voting power is much the same it would be in an ordinary game. Use those first two days wisely by getting as many good players killed as possible, and by killing specifically the players that will cause the most trouble if left alive.\nIf you have done your job well and all the dead players are good, you can call for your own exile - once you die, only the living may vote again as normal. This means that the voting power is once again in the hands of the evil players! Double whammy.\nAlternatively, you can kill an evil player or two in the first few days. This will mean that the evil team controls the voting process by sheer numbers in the mid-game, which is very powerful. With just 3 evil players and 3 good players voting, for example, it will be impossible for the good team to execute who they want to. Even with 2 evil players voting and 4 good players voting, good will need to coordinate extremely well to offset the enormous sway of the evil voting block. When you are the Voudon, death is not the end for evil players... many become significantly more influential.\nEngage the dead as much as possible, but discourage them from taking an active part in figuring out who is who. If YOU are the only person that really cares what the dead think, and you act as the coordinator between the dead players, who do you think that they will vote for on the final day? The player that you told them to vote for. Many living players only communicate with the living players. This is a mistake, but doubly so when the Voudon is in play, because the dead hold all the power. If you arrange things so that the living players are doing all the talking, and the dead are sitting there passively (or talking among themselves, or just to you), then the massive power of the dead will be overlooked, and they will vote foolishly. Ignore the living players, and make the dead players your friends and confidants, and victory is assured.",
        "Tips & Tricks (if you are good)": "You start the game extremely powerful, but get less and less powerful as the game progresses. On the first day, you decide who is executed, since you are the only player that can vote. Make the first day your best day, by putting a lot of thought into who you want to die. You have the authority to choose, so kill an evil player if you can. Execute on the first day, no matter what, because if you don't, you won't have the same voting power tomorrow.\nThe more evil players that you kill, the more dead evil players will be voting. This means that the best case scenario (for a game with three Minions) after 3 days, is that 3 dead players are evil, and more or less controlling who is executed next. If you suspect that this is the case, call for your own exile, because when you die the voting power goes back into the hands of the living, good players.\nThe more good players that die, the more that the good team controls the vote. Sometimes, it might be worth killing players that you suspect of being good just to get a few more good votes and a few fewer evil votes the day afterwards. This strategy relies on you staying alive, so make sure you have the good team's support. If you don't, remember that they can exile you just as easily as any other Traveller.\nOn the final day, remember that the dead have all the power. The living players should be talking to the dead like sleazy politicians campaigning for votes. The living are still the players making the nominations, but more often than not, all living players will be nominated on the final day anyway, which means the dead decide who wins, and who loses. Engage the dead players. Talk to them. Listen to them. Build trust and coordinate with them. Involve the dead players as much as possible, because active dead players are more likely to make good decisions, and passive dead players are more likely to be bamboozled by evil players' lies and vote counter-productively."
