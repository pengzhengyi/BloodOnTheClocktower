        "Bluffing as the Politician": "It can be a lot of fun to tease the player group, by hinting that you are the Politician without outright coming out as the Politician. By being so over-the-top, you might make other players second guess themselves. Plus, it\u2019s just awesome being outrageous. Then maybe hint that you're the Goblin if it's on the script and make them triple doubt themselves.\nIf you\u2019re on the chopping block as an evil player, claim that you\u2019re the Politician as a way to explain away your shady or evil actions. Promise to be good if they keep you alive. And then continue to hold this threat over their heads if they don't. However, using the Politician as a back up bluff can still backfire as people might want to execute you to reduce your voting and nominating ability.\nIf you think good is winning, claim that you\u2019re the Politician just to throw a massive spanner into the works. Suddenly there\u2019s a potentially extra evil vote in play, which the group has to take into account and it puts a lot more pressure on controlling the vote.\nTell a few people discreetly that you\u2019re the Politician, so that your shady and evil actions seem much more plausible later on. Afterwards, shamelessly nominate the Saint and try to get them executed, or try to get the wrong twin from the Evil Twin pair executed.\nTell one or two players that you\u2019re secretly a Politician, and suggest that they can make it worth your while not to undermine the good team. Use the threat of you possibly turning evil as a way to get the good team to do your own dirty work. Nothing more fun than a cat\u2019s paw. Direct which players the Lycanthrope chooses at night, get the good team to rat out the Poppy Grower.\nBluff as the Politician when there is already a Politician claim! This creates a lot of chaos and noise as players don\u2019t know which player to believe. Best of all, you can lean into this nonsense by upping the stakes and gunning for the most evil action.",
        "Tips & Tricks": "Come out with a bluff on day 1, and then stick with it. Don\u2019t deviate from your claim, don\u2019t change up your story, remain a consistent, static source of false information, and an unfailing obstacle to the good team\u2019s ability to piece together the truth. Claim to be an Artist who learned that Legion is in play, and force the good team to take that into account.\nBluff as extreme and ridiculous as you can! The more outlandish your bluff, the more chance that you will be the player most responsible for the loss, should the good team believe it! Pretend to be the Atheist! Pretend a Saint is your Evil Twin! Claim that you were Snakecharmed, then turned into the Klutz! Dominate the game with your crazy schemes and spread as much misinformation as possible. If the good team believes you, you can lock in a win for the evil team. Even if they don\u2019t, the havoc you have bring may be enough to lose the game for the good team anyway.\nBluff quietly and well. Do everything you can to make sure no one suspects you are the Politician, then feed in a crucial piece of misinformation at the last possible second. Come out with a piece of false Seamstress information on the final day that frames a good player as evil, and clinch the win.\nMake up some false information, and go hard after a specific player. Pretend to be an Investigator, a Fortune Teller, a Bounty Hunter, and set up another player as evil. If they\u2019re good, this can be the deciding factor that clinches a win for the evil team. If you accidentally get the Demon killed, well, you win anyway.\nPay attention to character win or lose conditions. Then try and trigger them. If you can engineer the execution of a Goblin, or a good Twin, or a second good player in a Leviathan game, your victory is all but assured.\nMake sure the Storyteller sees your efforts. Being a minor contributor to the good team\u2019s downfall isn\u2019t going to cut it. Make sure the Storyteller is aware that you are the player most responsible for your team losing.\nDon\u2019t rock the boat on the Outsider count. If there should only be one Outsider in play, and someone else is claiming to be the Recluse, don\u2019t challenge them. Remain hidden, and leave the good team in the dark \u2013 that single piece of misinformation about the Outsider count could be enough to win the day.\nIf good seems like they are on track to win, come out. Remember, you can win with the good team too. The information you can provide \u2013 which evil players are going along with your evil schemes, who has reacted to you double-claiming their characters, that you are an Outsider - could be the piece needed to win the game.\nTry and catch characters who detect alignment (but not character) in your schemes. Convince a Seamstress to check you against a confirmed good player, or a Moonchild to choose you after they die. Remember, you register as good \u2013 having you confirmed in their eyes can lead a lot of credence to your devious claims.\nHave characters with powerful, single-use abilities expend them on you. Convince a Slayer to shoot you, nominate a Virgin, or convince a Professor to try and resurrect you. Make them use up their powerful abilities on a Politician, and undermine their efforts to gather information and make progress.\nTie the vote on the final day. Even if you are dead. This is MEAN, but it works! If the good team doesn't execute on the final day, and then the Demon kills that night, evil will win. To win as the Politician using this method, you will need to be the player that cast the crucial vote - if the good team accidentally tied the vote, you will lose too. Your ability says \"If you were the player MOST responsible...\"\nDon't nominate at all on the final day if you think the other alive players are all evil. This will prevent the Demon from being nominated at all.\nIf a Politician is on the script and you are not the Politician, be very careful who you trust. The Politician may be in play, throwing all manner of spanners in the works, yet registering as a good player. Just because someone appears good to a character like the Seamstress, Empath or Noble, doesn't mean that you can trust them. Even if you are certain that nobody is drunk or poisoned."
