        "Bluffing as the Balloonist": "Remember that the Balloonist player isn't shown an an alignment, character, or character type, and doesn't know in what order the players are being shown. The Balloonist player is woken each night, the Storyteller points to a player, then the Balloonist goes back to sleep.\nRemember that if you're bluffing as the Balloonist, there should be an additional Outsider in play. You should have a chat with another evil player who comes out as an Outsider to help bolster your claim. You claim you\u2019re the Balloonist, and another player says they\u2019re the Butler and the group waits for another Outsider claim. The Demon, wanting to play into your bluff comes out as the Sweetheart pretends to gets angry at you for forcing their hand and revealing themselves.\nThe Balloonist\u2019s information is about trying to point out that two or more players cannot be the same type. You can pretend to use this information to make good players seem evil. Two players come out as Townsfolk, but then you reveal that you are the Balloonist, meaning that if you were telling the truth, one of those Townsfolk claims is false (of course, you\u2019re lying, but they don\u2019t know that yet). One player claims to be the Mayor and another player claims to be a Bounty Hunter, you can suggest that one of them is lying about their character type by suggesting that your information includes both of them.\nBe very careful in what players you choose. Clumsily claiming players as part of your set can accidentally implicate yourself and/or your demon, leaving you in a real pickle if you need to change your story.\nThe Balloonist is a really good claim to fall back on if you don\u2019t have a claim straight away. The Balloonist has good reason to try and hide even right up till the final night. They are trying to fly under the radar for a total of four nights.\nBecause the Balloonist eventually learns who the Demon is, if you\u2019re able to survive four nights, you can reveal four players, none of which are the Demon. However, when you do this, you\u2019re about to indirectly accuse two players of being evil. If there is another Minion in play, maybe throw them under the bus to make your information seem more credible, because it doesn\u2019t matter as long as you mislead the group on who the Demon is.\nWhen pointing the finger at four players, make sure that you are pointing at an Outsider in that group. If you forget to do so, you might be left contradicting yourself, saying you added an Outsider but not having a set that excludes an/the Outsider claim.\nWhen pointing the finger at four players, make sure that at least one of them stays alive, if you want to stay alive too. After all four players die, the good team will know that you are lying, because the Demon was supposed to be one of those four dead players.\nIf people believe that you are the Balloonist, you can get eight good players killed - a character that you implicate each day, and the character that the Demon kills at night. This is basically a sure victory for the evil team. Getting eight good players a one-way ticket to dead-town is incredibly helpful, and this is much more devastating than other characters can do. The real Balloonist can get 4 players executed, 2 of which you really do want executed. But a fake Balloonist gets 4 players that you really do want executed.",
        "Tips & Tricks": "Keep your identity a secret for as long as possible. If the Balloonist can survive for four nights, including the first, they learn 4 people, 1 of which is the Demon. Even in a 7-player game that cuts out half of the options. In a 15-player game, that narrows the window down to less than a third of the game.\nCome out early if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll survive the whole game. You added an Outsider to the game, but that isn\u2019t wholly a bad thing. Being able to trust the extra Outsider claim once you find them is very valuable for your team's deductions. You can probably help confirm the increased Outsider count, and this means there is now a small cluster of probably trusted good players. In an 8-player game, there should only be 1 Outsider, but 2 players come out as Outsiders. You can then come out as the Balloonist, and your claim now seems credible, and well as making the Outsiders seem credible. That\u2019s three players who are likely to be good.\nIn a small game, it\u2019s highly likely that there won\u2019t even be 4 nights. In this case, your info probably won\u2019t help you learn who the Demon is, but it will likely help you determine maybe two players who are different character types. You learn 2 different players before dying, but you learn that one of them is the Golem therefore, the other one has to be not an Outsider, and 2 out of 3 of those options are evil.\nHalf the players you get shown are good, and half are evil. Even if you cannot figure out who the Demon is, your information tells you that two of these players know they\u2019re on the same team and two players don\u2019t know they are. You learn 4 players, and you've been observing 2 of them colluding since the beginning of the game, while 2 of them haven't been interacting at all. It is very likely that you've managed to discover the Demon one of its Minions working together.\nIn larger games, your information is extremely powerful, and it gets more powerful the more you get. However, even an incomplete set still has value. For example, if you know that three players are different character types, you know that at least one of them is evil, and at least one of them is good. Therefore, you can deduce that any theories that have your whole set as on your team are suspect, because there has to be a Minion or Demon in there somewhere.\nIf you\u2019re ever poisoned on any of those four nights, it undermines the whole 4 nights of information. Remember this as you are a high priority target for being poisoned. If there is a Widow or a Poisoner in play, they\u2019re likely to want to poison you. You get good information on 3 different nights, but on the night you would have learned who the Demon is, you get poisoned, and learn a second Townsfolk instead.\nIf you can confirm the role of one of the players you are shown, you\u2019ll learn that all other players seen cannot be that role. If one of the players you see can be proven to be a Townsfolk because of the Virgin, you know all other players you see are not Townsfolk.\nIf you are in a game that should have no Outsiders by default, try to find an Outsider as this will give you credibility. More importantly, since they will have to be the Outsider you get shown, you will know that all other targets you are shown cannot be Outsiders.\nBe careful of characters with abilities that register as something else. A Recluse might falsely register as the Minion to you, and the Spy might falsely register as the Outsider to you.\nIf you ever learn yourself from the storyteller, that is fantastic information. It means the rest of your set aren\u2019t Townsfolk, and so if any of them do claim to be Townsfolk, you have good reason to be suspicious. Additionally, most of the remaining players you will learn will be evil, one being the Minion and the other the demon, leaving only the Outsider as on your team. Learning yourself as the Townsfolk is very rare though, and the Storyteller will only do it in a Teensyville game, or when the good team has very little other information, or both.\nIf the town has no idea who to execute, but still wants someone to die, someone that you have learnt isn\u2019t the worst option - even if you think that they are good. You have a 25% chance of getting the Demon randomly. Those odds of instant victory aren\u2019t anything to sneeze at."
