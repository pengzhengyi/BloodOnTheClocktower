Whilst having an abundance of power and a lack of information can be fun for some players, others like something more. The Duchess adds regular information to such a game.\nIt is the responsibility of the players to decide among themselves which players will be the 3 players to visit. If exactly 3 visitors can not be decided upon, then the Duchess does not act tonight.\nEach player that visits the Duchess learns how many visitors are evil, including themselves. However, 1 visitor will definitely get false information - it is your choice whom. Players that visit the Duchess still get to use their character ability normally. The Duchess does not make their character ability give false information."
