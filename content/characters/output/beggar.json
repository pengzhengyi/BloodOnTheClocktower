        "Tips & Tricks (if you are evil)": "Learn the alignment of as many players as possible. Take vote tokens from as many players as possible. Even though by talking to the Demon you can learn the alignments of all players quickly, the more players that give you their vote tokens, the more players will not be able to vote on the final day. You'll be able to vote as much as you want, and that is a powerful enough ability to win the game. Good players often don't realize how powerful their dead vote is - 1 player giving it away to an evil Beggar might not make much difference, but 4 players doing so will make a huge difference.\nWhen good players give your their token, tell the truth about their alignment in order to gain their trust. If you publicly tell the group that a good player is good, that goes some way in confirming their legitimacy (and therefore their information), but you may be able to convince more players to give you their token. You can lie about their alignment at a later date.\nLie about good players' alignment, if you think that you can get away with it. It is much more common for good players to give their vote tokens to Beggars, so claiming that an evil player has done so is a difficult bluff. But, it is possible, and if you succeed, you have not only convinced the group of the illegitimacy of their information, you have gained a vote and convinced them of your goodness. The good player will kick and scream and do everything they can to convince the group that you are evil, so be prepared.\nLie about evil players alignment, if evil players give you their tokens. There is usually not much to be gained by telling the group that an evil player is evil, beyond making yourself look good. Sure, you'll get the benefit of looking more trustworthy (and maybe even getting another player to give up their vote token), but you've sacrificed the evil player to do so. The Chef, Empath, Investigator and Undertaker in particular are very good at using the simple fact that one player is evil to deduce the alignment of several other players.\nTell the truth about evil players to build trust. But do so rarely. Very rarely. Since it is so unlikely that an evil Beggar would actually tell the group the truth about an evil player's alignment, when you actually do it, it may be believed. You'll want to make sure the payoff is worth it though. It can be worth it if the evil player was heavily suspicious anyway, or if the evil player was the third or fourth player to give you their vote token. In such circumstances, building the group's faith that you are good can give you the edge and keep you alive.\nUse your vote wisely or throw it away. Either way, it doesn't really matter. What is important is that you look like you use your vote wisely, and that you save at least one vote token for the final day. The final day is all that really matters, so who you vote for before that point is mostly about making you look trustworthy so that you can survive until the final day.\nBe proactive in getting players to give you their vote token. Ask. Demand. Bargain. Beg. Others will not usually volunteer to give you their token, because they have other things on their mind, but will often consider it if you pester them a little.",
        "Tips & Tricks (if you are good)": "You definitely want to learn the alignment of at least one player, but don't get too greedy. Learning 1 or 2 player's alignment could mean that 1 or 2 good players can no longer vote - this is probably acceptable. But learning 5 players' alignment could mean that 5 good players can no longer vote - and that gives evil the majority vote at the next execution, granting evil the win. Gain a vote token or two... or three... but know when to stop.\nTell the truth about good players who give you their vote token. You trust them. They will probably trust you. Have a private conversation about your combined strategy for the future, and tell the group that they are good. You can trust whatever information this good player has due to their character ability, so use that to your advantage and let them help you decide who to vote for.\nLie about a good player who gave you their vote token. If you tell the group that a good player is in fact evil, the Demon or its Minions may seek you out and tell you who they are, believing that you are evil too. This could be amazing information. Either way, you'll want to tell the group that you were lying before the game ends, and reveal your strategy to them, otherwise they may believe that you are evil, or that the good player who selflessly gave you their token is evil.\nIf an evil player is foolish enough or brave enough to give you their vote token, tell the truth about their alignment. Tell the group that the player is evil, and be prepared for that player to accuse you of being evil. Since it is rare for evil players to give their vote to a good beggar (but some will do so because it is so unexpected), you may find it difficult to convince the group that they are evil. It will be easier to convince the group if you can get a good player's vote token as well, as that good player will probably help you.\nIf an evil player has given you their vote token, you may want to lie about their alignment. Tell the group they they are good - this may convince the evil players that you are evil, and will encourage more evil players to give you their vote token. On the final day, you can reveal the truth.\nYou can't vote. So, when you do get a vote token, use it very, very wisely. This is especially important because you may have removed a good player's ability to vote when you took their token, which means that good has less voting power overall. Make your vote count by saving it until the final day, or waiting to use it when your vote will decide whether a player is executed or not.\nBe proactive in getting players to give you their vote token. Ask. Demand. Bargain. Beg. Others will not usually volunteer to give you their token, because they have other things on their mind, but will often consider it if you pester them a little."
