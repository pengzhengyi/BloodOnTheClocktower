        "Bluffing as the Huntsman": "If you were the Huntsman, a Damsel would also be in play. At some stage, another evil player is going to need to claim to be the Damsel, otherwise you are going to look pretty dodgy. Another evil player can come out as the Damsel after they die. If you claim to be the Huntsman, and another evil player is claiming to be the Damsel, that's much more trustworthy than having a lonely Huntsman looking suspicious.\nPretending to be the Huntsman might flush out a real Damsel. If you are convincing enough in your \"search for the Damsel\" and manage to trick the real Damsel into revealing who they are, a Minion can guess who the Damsel is and win the game.\nThe Huntsman can be a useful fallback bluff if your initial bluff falls apart, because the Huntsman is a good character that has reasons not to come out early. If you\u2019re claiming to be the Washerwoman or the Virgin and your bluff falls apart, you can then come out as the Huntsman saying you were trying to hide your real character.\nIf you\u2019re a Minion, you know if the Damsel is in play or not, and if not, you therefore know the Huntsman is also not in play. It\u2019s then relatively safe for two evil players to tag-team as a Huntsman/Damsel duo. The only risk is if you tag-team like this, then it\u2019s expected that Damsel has become an out-of-play Townsfolk. Chat to the Demon to find out one of their bluffs for the Damsel to become. Alternatively, you can be the Huntsman and claim that a dead Minion is the Damsel to make them seem more trustworthy.\nClaim to be the Huntsman even if this creates a double up. If there is no other Huntsman the Damsel is more likely to trust you. If there is another Huntsman you\u2019re going to create a dilemma and give the Damsel terrible anxiety so they won't want to claim to either of you and potentially just get themselves executed rather than risking one of you being able to pick them successfully, thereby spending another execution that isn't on your Demon and also neutralising the useful potential of the actual Huntsman ability.",
        "Tips & Tricks": "Find the Damsel ASAP. You have one shot and you\u2019re racing against either you or them dying before you can find them! This can be more important in smaller games as the chances of either player dying early is higher, but also your chances of being correct with a blind pick is higher. On the first night of a small game, you're often better off just taking a punt tonight rather than gambling you both survive to tomorrow and the Damsel gets an ability they can use that night.\nWait to use your ability until you're really sure. You only have one opportunity to get it right and there is a lot of fun to be had during the hunting. Try to partner up with characters that can learn about characters like Dreamer. Even the Undertaker can be great for you as confirming that the Damsel is dead verifies that fact for you and lets you know you're no longer on your Damsel-hunting sidequest but onto the main Demon-hunting campaign!\nThe Damsel is likely to be flighty and paranoid, and may even be trying to get themselves killed. Use your ability on people who seem shifty or quiet as they might be a Damsel. If a character seems to be keen to volunteer themselves for execution, privately ask them if they'd like you to guess them as the Damsel that night. Be careful though, this might just be an evil player trying to bait you into wasting your ability.\nPrivately claim to be the Damsel to other players. This can be useful to flush out the Damsel and the various Minions. Characters that can prove who they are, like the Virgin or Golem, can be great to give you a trusted person to arrange a private meeting as both you and the Damsel can freely claim your respective characters to this confirmed player.\nStay alive at any cost. You can claim you've used your ability already, or that you\u2019ve already found your Damsel, meaning you\u2019re no longer a threat to evil. Watch what happens if you publicly claim a random person as your Damsel. However, be careful as the Damsel might decide they are now a risk with no potential reward if you're claiming to have used your ability and try to get themselves killed.\nTry to flush out the Minions or lure them into a trap to make a public guess. Go around to various shady people claiming to be the Damsel or ask a trusted good player to accidentally let slip there's a Damsel in play to someone you're not sure of just after they've spoken to you. If the Minions are baited into spending their guess on you (or anyone who isn't the Damsel for that matter!), they can't hurt your real Damsel anymore."
