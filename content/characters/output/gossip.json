        "Bluffing as the Gossip": "There are roughly two ways to bluff as the gossip - the safe way and the risky way. The safe way is to make safe statements, and do your best to give useless information to the group - this way, the good team is likely to believe that you are good, but ignore your information. Like bluffing as the Soldier, this tends to be safe, but the lack of false information in the group discussion can bite you later on. The riskier way to bluff is to make your Gossip statements as controversial as possible, and do your best to convince the group that your false statements are true, and your true statements are false - this creates a lot of confusion and uncertainty. Like bluffing as the Fortune Teller, this can be riskier initially, but the increased level of false information in the group can work to your advantage.\nAs a default, deliberately give false false statements. Since there is no real Gossip in play to get people killed, giving false statements looks more reliable, as it matches the lower kill-count of a night time.\nYou can't kill with bluff alone, so be careful giving statements you think are 'true'. However, if you are a Minion that wants to be executed in order to save the Demon, then of course you want to give true statements that look suspicious! However, if the Demon is a multi-kill Demon such as the Shabaloth or the Po, then giving regular true-sounding statements can be quite easily believable. Basically, coordinate your statements against the number of deaths at night - true statements are more believable when there's a lot of deaths, false when there are fewer.\nTime a false Gossip statement with an unusual death, such as the Assassin or the Godfather to make it look like your last statement was true. Act shocked! Or, if a good player such as the Tinker, Gambler or Grandmother dies of a night time, you can convince the group that not only was your statement true, but that the Tinker, Gambler or Grandmother might be lying.",
        "Tips & Tricks": "Get over your fear of death! A lot of Gossips will be tentative about using their ability, since they're worried about causing a death accidentally. While it's true you should be cautious with any ability that could cause death, the potential gain in information more than makes up for the risk. Use your ability every day!\nSimilar to the Artist in Sects & Violets, you are an extremely flexible and versatile information gatherer. Since you can make literally any statement you like about anything, you can cover gaps in the good team, back up other players' information, or ask that one question that everyone desperately wants to know but have no way to find out! Take full advantage of this and the good team will be thanking you.\nBe precise with your statements! A vague statement that could be true OR false (e.g. \"The demon made someone look evil yesterday.\") won't be helpful to you when you're trying to figure out if someone died as a result of your ability. Instead, aim for binary statements that could be definitely true or false (\"The demon nominated yesterday.\")\nDeliberately say statements that you believe are false. This reduces the risk that you will kill a player, but still allow you to gain information. If nobody dies (or at least, you don't think anyone died because of you), then you can reverse your statement to get the truth! (e.g. Saying \"The Chambermaid is not in play\" deliberately because you believe another player is the Chambermaid. When no deaths occur, you can trust their claim a little more!)\nDeliberately say true statements! This can be advantageous for two reasons. One, if someone dies because of you, it'll be hard to deny you're the Gossip (providing you can trace that death back to you and not one of the many other causes, anyway. This will be less effective in a game with multi-kill demon like Shabaloth or Po!). Two, if someone dies as a result of your ability, then you can be very confident that the statement was true (Deliberately saying false statements does not account for your ability malfunctioning, so if you suspect that could be the case, this is the way to confirm it!)\nBe wary of the game state and time what kind of statements you say. If it's late enough in the game, an extra death at night could be all the evil team needs to squeeze out a victory. As the amount of living players runs low, try to avoid saying anything that could cause an extra death, just to be on the safe side.\nNot sure what sort of statements you can make? Here's some examples!\n\"The demon is a Zombuul.\"\n\"Steven is evil.\"\n\"The evil players are sitting next to each other.\"\n\"The Assassin has used their ability.\"\n\"Marianna is the Courtier.\"\n\"Both of my neighbours are good.\""
