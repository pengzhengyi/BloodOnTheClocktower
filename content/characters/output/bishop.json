        "Tips & Tricks (if you are evil)": "Do whatever you can to convince the group that you are good. Some Travellers don't really mind whether the group believes that that they are good. The Judge, or the Voudon, for example, can use their ability and gain a benefit no matter what the good players think. But if the good players get even a whiff that you might be evil, they will exile you immediately and your ability will not have been very helpful. However, if you can survive for several days, your ability is devastating, because not only are evil players not being nominated (generally - the Storyteller may do so every so often to keep up appearances), but the good team will be focused on deducing who is evil based on who is being nominated... and all their conclusions will be false.\nVote as often as you can. You have the perfect excuse - that the nominated player is probably evil! After all... you are the good Bishop, aren't you? If the good team believes that you are good, then they should be voting for each possible executee as well. With no Bishop in play, it is possible for all nominations during a day to be nominations of good players. But with a good Bishop in play, there is always an opportunity to kill an evil player. If you have convinced the group that you are good... vote, vote, vote.\nOn the final day, ask the group if they wish to Exile you. Most Storytellers will nominate the Demon on the final day regardless of your alignment, so you are not losing much if you die. And, the fact that you are asking to be Exiled usually works to help you not be exiled!\nWhenever a day ends where only good players were nominated, spend as much time as you can the following day directing the group's attention to the \"fact\" that at least one of yesterday's nominees was evil. If say, 4 players were nominated yesterday, you can generate a lot of suspicion about those 4 players, and maybe get one (or two, or three!) of them executed in the following days. Every day you direct the good team's attention to killing themselves is a day that the Demon lives, and the evil voting balance is tipped towards evil. Even if you don't end up getting these players executed, turning the discussion away from more dangerous topics and towards the completely useless topic of \"which of these 4 players is evil?\", you can waste the good team's time, energy and focus on pointless diversions.",
        "Tips & Tricks (if you are good)": "Pay very close attention to who the Storyteller nominates each day. Every day, the Storyteller must nominate at least one evil player. Usually, the Storyteller will nominate only one evil player and several good players. Pay attention day after day, and narrow down the pool of possible evil players. For example, if on day 1 the Storyteller nominates the Fool, the Chambermaid and the Tinker, then the day after nominates the Tinker, the Exorcist, the Grandmother and the Sailor, you can assume that either the Tinker is evil, or the Tinker is good, and 1 of each of the other groups of characters is evil.\nStay alive. You know you are good. You know that you are getting useful information each day. But, the other players don't. What they see is probably a player that is preventing them from nominating, and little more. You'll need to convince the good team to keep you alive - even though it is in their best interests to do so. Share what you learn, or vote how they want you to vote - do anything you can to stay alive long enough to gather some clues on who is good and who is evil.\nOn the final day, the Storyteller will definitely nominate the Demon. If the Storyteller just nominates two players on the final day, you'll have narrowed the possible Demon candidates down to 2 players instead of 3. This is significant. If you can convince the other players that you are good, they will gain the benefit too.\nYou get more powerful as the game progresses. If there are 12 players alive, the Storyteller can nominate a lot of players. But if there are just 4 players alive, the Storyteller will probably be nominating 4 or fewer players. Ideally, you want the Storyteller to nominate either 2 or 3 players in a day - the fewer, the better. Whilst you have no control over what the Storyteller does, what you can do is put your attention on the times when the fewest players were nominated during the day."
