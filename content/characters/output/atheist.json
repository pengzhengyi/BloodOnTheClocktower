        "Bluffing as the Atheist": "If you are a Minion, you can bluff as the Atheist without worrying that there will be another Atheist in play. There are no evil players in an Atheist game, so the fact that you are an evil Minion means that there is no Atheist.\nIf you are the Demon, you can bluff as the Atheist, even if the Storyteller doesn't show you the Atheist as a bluff. There are no evil players in an Atheist game, so the fact that you are an evil player means that there is no Atheist.\nIf you are bluffing as the Atheist, be prepared for the players to execute you at some stage. It is rare that any player claiming to be the Atheist will survive until the final day. So, bluffing as the Atheist tends to work best for characters who's ability is already used, such as the Baron, or will be used by the time you die, such as the Mezepheles. If there are characters that can keep the game going after the Demon dies, such as the Scarlet Woman or Mastermind or Imp, then this makes an Atheist bluff easier for the Demon.\nThe first major strategy to win the game via an Atheist bluff is to spend your time convincing the good team that you are the Atheist. Unlike other characters, this may need a more social approach than usual, as most Atheists are loud and confident in what they know and what needs to happen to win. However, using the good team's information against them can also work, such as a Empath learning that you are evil or a poisoned Empath learning you are good - both of these result can be used as evidence that you are indeed the Atheist, since the Storyteller can break the rules to give the good team false information.\nThe second major strategy to win the game via an Atheist bluff is to convince the good team that the information that they have is inconsistent, that it points to too many players being evil, that it doesn't make sense. This is different than trying to convince them that a particular player or group of players is evil, which wouldn't make sense if you are the Atheist. If you can confuse the good team as to what is happening, they may execute the Storyteller in haste, or execute the wrong evil players and let the Demon survive. Either way, evil wins. This strategy works best with characters that can cause a lot of confusion, such as the Poisoner or the Vigormortis.\nThe third major strategy to win the game via an Atheist bluff is to convince the good team that the information that they have makes too much sense! In a real Atheist game, the Storyteller will often be trying their best to make all the information consistent, or at least to make all players appear to be good. Making the argument that everything is making too much sense is making the argument that the Storyteller is responsible. This strategy works best with characters that can appear to be good, such as the Spy or the Imp.\nIf your plan is to convince the group that all players are good, get your teammates to give false information that is either very consistent or wildly inaccurate. If you goal is to get a few good players executed to increase the final-day chances of an evil win, get your teammates to give false information that converges on particular players being evil.",
        "Storyteller Advice": "...to be added soon.",
        "Tips & Tricks": "If you are the Atheist, you know who the Demon is: nobody. You know exactly what to do to win the game: execute the Storyteller. If you can convince the other players that you are indeed the Atheist, then that will be enough to win the game.\nDon't be too fussed if the other players don't believe you at first, and want to execute a few players. Executing the Storyteller on day one just because one player claims to be the Atheist is a big risk for most players to take, and it is smart to play for a few days to get as much information as possible. Claim that you are the Atheist, again and again, and have patience.\nReveal your character early. There isn't really much point lying about who you are, since there are no evil players to fool, and no Demon attacks to avoid at night.\nConvince as many players as possible to reveal their characters and information as early as possible. There is little point hiding information, since the player you need to beat is the Storyteller, and the Storyteller already knows everything.\nIf there are characters on the script that could make you drunk, such as the Drunk or the Puzzlemaster, do everything you can to figure out whether or not you are drunk. If you are the Drunk, then you are not the Atheist at all, there is no Atheist in play, there are hidden evil players amongst you, and executing the Storyteller will result in the evil team winning. If you are made drunk by characters such as the Puzzlemaster, then the Storyteller may rule that executing the Storyteller with a drunk Atheist in play results in the good team losing - if so, you will need to remove the source of the drunkenness before executing the Storyteller.\nDon't be afraid to die. Most players will want to kill the Atheist at some stage, just in case you are evil. Dying so that the good team can win is worth it, even though it will result in the Storyteller killing an extra player (or more!) that night.\nIf all the good team's information makes sense and is consistent, then kill all the players that this information points to as evil. Once all these players are dead, it should be much easier to convince the other players that you are the Atheist.\nIf the good team's information has some noticeable inconsistencies, such as once player learning that an Evil Twin is in play and another learning that a Scarlet Woman is in play in a one-Minion game, then highlight these inconsistencies to the group as evidence that the Storyteller is breaking the rules.\nIf there are any characters in play that have game-ending abilities, such as the Mayor or Saint, then check with the Storyteller as to whether or not the game will end if you take a risky action. It is best that all players know beforehand, when they are about to do something that could end the game, with either a win or a loss."
