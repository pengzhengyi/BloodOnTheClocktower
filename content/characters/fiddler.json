Maybe some players need to leave unexpectedly and the game can not continue without them. Maybe the Townsfolk refuse to kill during the day, and the Demon refuses to kill at night.\nThe Fiddler can be activated by you at any time. To do so, all players close their eyes while the Demon selects a living good player to challenge to a fiddle contest. Then, after a minute or two, all players will choose (by raising a hand) which of these 2 players wins. The game is then over, and the winning player's entire team wins too."
