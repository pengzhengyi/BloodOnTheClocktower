        "Explanation": "When creating character lists using the Script, it is a good idea to include no more than one character that adds evil characters. If two or more players turn evil, then the evil team can win simply by revealing who they are and winning due to their voting majority. Adding the Spirit of Ivory prevents too many players turning evil, and creates a more fun and fair game for the good players.\nWith a Spirit of Ivory in play, only one more player than normal can ever be evil. If a second player would become evil, they stay good instead.\nThe normal number of evil players is printed on the Traveller sheet, and on the Setup sheet."
