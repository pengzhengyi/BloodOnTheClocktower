        "Bluffing as the Innkeeper": "If you are the Demon, kill different players that the ones you claim to protect. If you claim to have protected the Chambermaid during the night, and the Chambermaid is dead in the morning, then you have some explaining to do. If you are the Demon, or if you are a Minion that can co-ordinate with the Demon, you can attack players different to the ones you claim to protect.\nIf your fellow evil players have bluffs that aren't working too well, claim to have protected them. This will make one or both of them look like they may be drunk, which gives them an excuse for the malfunctioning of their ability, whilst also providing an extra reason why they are still alive.\nIf good players are being being particularly troublesome, claim to protect them. The imagined possibility that they are drunk can throw enough doubt and confusion into the mix to effectively nullify their ability.\nTo gain good team's trust, whilst also being a massive pain in the ass, privately tell people that you are the Innkeeper. Good players will often want to reveal their identity to the Innkeeper so as to either gain the Innkeeper's protection (if they are a character that wants to live at all costs) or to make sure that the Innkeeper never ever picks them (because they need be sober to use their ability). Knowing which players are which characters helps you directly, because you know who to kill, but it also makes those players trust you more.\nHave a backup bluff prepared in case it gets far too suspicious that you're still alive in the late game. It is rare, but not impossible for an Innkeeper to survive to the late game. Having a good reason to have been \"lying\", such as claiming to have been the Fool all along, can be helpful. Characters such as the Fool, Sailor, Goon, or a player sitting next to a Tea Lady all have good reasons to lie about who they are to attract a Demon's attention, and the Innkeeper is a particularly juicy target for the Demon.",
        "Tips & Tricks": "Your ability is powerful and when used effectively you can stall the evil team and keep your fellow good team safe. The price of your ability is steep, however - anyone protected by you becomes unreliable as they may be drunk for the night that they survive. Coordinating with your fellow good players to find ideal targets to protect is absolutely vital - some characters (such as the Pacifist and the Exorcist) become stronger the longer they survive, and you can enable that.\nBe mindful of the drunkenness your ability causes! Don't protect people who need to receive reliable information or use their ability with any sort of guarantee that night. If you know for example that a Courtier is about to use their ability, you protecting them may cause them to become drunk and waste their powerful ability!\nProtect different people than who you publicly claim to be protecting. If the evil team believes what you are saying, they will not want to waste time targeting players who can't be killed. Meanwhile, you secretly protect other players that are potential victims, hopefully blocking the evil team from a necessary kill.\nIt can seem like a good idea to protect yourself using your ability, but this is generally not recommended - it is likely that the Storyteller will choose to make you drunk by your own ability, completely negating your protection and making both you and the other player vulnerable.\nIf you think you know at least 2 evil players, select them both! Guarding them from death isn't ideal, but it does mean that one of them will be drunk that night. If you manage to get your hands on the Demon or a potent Minion like the Assassin or the Devil's Advocate, you're cutting off evil abilities at source! If you miss, though, you can almost guarantee that whichever player is good will be drunk."
