Whilst it is not necessary, even a minor possibility of a good player's information being incorrect can drastically help the evil players bluff successfully.\nThe Fibbin can't make a character power fail in the way that drunkenness and poisoning do. It can only affect character abilities that gain information due to you signalling to them during the night, or telling them something verbally.\nIf the game ends before you have given a good player false information, that's ok."
