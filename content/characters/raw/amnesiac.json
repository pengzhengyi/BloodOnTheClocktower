        "Bluffing as the Amnesiac": "You don\u2019t actually need to have an ability in mind when you start bluffing Amnesiac, but you\u2019ll probably want to have a strong idea by the end of the game.\nWhen bluffing your ability, you\u2019ll probably need to fake getting information from the Storyteller at night. Such information can include:\nNumbers\nPointing at players\nYeses and Nos\nCharacter tokens\nThumbs up (good) and thumbs down (evil)\nDon\u2019t forget to visit the Storyteller each day, as that\u2019s what an Amnesiac would do. Remember that the clues the Storyteller gives for Amnesiac guesses are as follows.\nCold, your question has no relation to your ability.\nWarm, your question has some relation to your ability.\nHot, you\u2019re close to guessing your ability.\nBingo, you\u2019ve guessed your ability.\nPretend to guess your ability. Inventing and then solving a fake ability gives literally limitless room for deception. You can steer your ability over the course of the game to arrive at any conclusion of your choosing, such as casting doubt on good players, supporting evil players, or making good players doubt their information.\n\u201cGetting it\u201d early versus late each has its own merits. Because you\u2019re lying about your ability, you may be able to easily spread lies as soon as you have your ability \u201cfigured out\u201d. However, if you guess your ability so fast that it seems unrealistic, you may cast undue suspicion on yourself.\nPretend to never guess your ability! If you never \u201cget it\u201d, you won't be obligated to share information with the town, because you don\u2019t have any. Additionally, this may make other players sympathetic to you, seeing as you never figured out your puzzle.\nWhen you are \u201cstuck\u201d on your ability. Invite the town to try and figure it out with you. This can be very helpful in distracting the town\u2019s deduction efforts away from finding your Demon and towards solving your unsolvable riddle.",
        "Tips & Tricks": "Most, though not all, Amnesiac abilities are information abilities of some kind or another, and they are usually more powerful than your average Townsfolk ability (due to the risk that you might not guess it). This makes your ability especially useful, should you figure it out.\nYou\u2019re free to be as broad or as specific as you like when asking clarifying questions of the Storyteller. It\u2019s probably best to start with bigger questions like \u201cDoes my ability have to do with Outsiders?\u201d and later move on to more specific questions like \u201cam I learning if the player I choose has a character name that starts with L?\u201d.\nMany Amnesiac abilities will have you choosing players at night. Try to vary who you choose to get a variety of data to deduce from.\nWhen guessing the nature of your ability, keep in mind the various mechanical hooks of the game your ability might relate to, such as\u2026\nCharacters: Who is a particular character? Who is a particular type such as Minion or Outsider? Does the character name start or end with a particular letter? Is the character in a certain position on the script page?\nPowers: Are you making players drunk? Can you publicly choose players and do something to them? Did you give information to another player at night? Do you change or swap characters or alignments? Are you preventing or causing deaths?\nPhysical arrangement: Who\u2019s sitting next to whom? Who\u2019s sitting across from whom? Who nominated today? Who voted today?\nSocial behavior: Who is winning? Who is lying? Who is correct?\nFeel free to ask for the town\u2019s help in trying to figure out your ability. If you can\u2019t figure out what 1,3,1,2,1 means, perhaps your allies can.\nRemember that your Storyteller tried to make your ability reasonable to guess. If theories seem so outlandish that you don\u2019t believe the Storyteller would make it your ability, it may be worth discounting them on those merits."
